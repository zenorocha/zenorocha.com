"As a preview for <a href="http://alloyui.com/">AlloyUI</a> was just released (together with the new website) Olaf Kock took the opportunity to have a episode about the UI layer on Radio Liferay. Luckily two members of the core team, Eduardo Lundgren (with Liferay since 2007/8) and Zeno Rocha (Sep 2012) volunteered, both of them are members of the brazilian team."
