Resend just raised a $18M Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz.

We're powering millions of [transactional](https://resend.com/products/transactional-emails) and [marketing](https://resend.com/products/marketing-emails) emails per day, and we're excited to continue building the future of communication.

## How we got here

It's been only **18 months** since we [publicly launched Resend](https://x.com/resend/status/1668622792919773187).

Now, more than **200,000 developers** have signed up.

Some of the biggest brands in the world, like Warner Brothers and Decathlon, and fast-growing startups like Braintrust and Raycast use Resend.

Our open source project, [React Email](https://react.email), just crossed **300,000 weekly downloads** on npm, 14,000 stars on GitHub, and more than 130 contributors.

And this - all of this - is just the beginning.

## Why we exist

Communication is a fundamental part of any software, and developers are uniquely positioned to integrate their favorite tools early on.

Today, we have new paradigms with serverless, and there are many opportunities to make communication **easier, faster, and more reliable**.

Resend exists to make human communication easier. We do that through the internet and the protocols that surround it, like email.

We will double down on this vision of building an **exceptional developer experience** for companies to communicate with their users.

## Where are we going

You can expect our team to spend even more time in three areas:

**1. Reliability**

As we exponentially grow the number of users, we need to ensure that your emails are always delivered and on time.

We will keep investing in infrastructure, scalability, uptime, and performance.

**2. Product**

We just shipped the ability to schedule emails using natural language, deliverability insights to help you land emails in the inbox instead of the spam folder, and much more.

In the next few months, you can expect Resend to help not only with sending, but also receiving emails, better segmenting your contacts, and personalizing your emails.

**3. Support**

Many companies see their support team as a cost center. For them, it's just a group of people who handle issues and complaints or an expensive add-on to drive revenue.

We feel the opposite. We know that great support is a core part of what makes Resend valuable. Phenomenal support not only helps us retain customers but also helps us grow through word of mouth.
