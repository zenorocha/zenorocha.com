<p>Two weeks ago I was in San Francisco for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/169452272/">SFHTML5</a>. This meetup was all about Polymer and I gave a talk called <em>"Web Components: a chance to create the future"</em>.</p>

<p>Slides are now available on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/zenorocha/web-components-a-chance-to-create-the-future">SpeakerDeck</a> and the video is on YouTube.</p>
