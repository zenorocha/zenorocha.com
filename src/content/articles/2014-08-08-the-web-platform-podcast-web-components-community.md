Web Components are a set of emerging and rapidly changing technologies
alter the way many developers are starting to build web applications.
[Zeno Rocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha), a dominant force in the front end
development community talks with hosts [Erik Isaksen](https://twitter.com/eisaksen)
& [Christian Smith](https://twitter.com/anvilhacks) on how developers can get
started building with these technologies today & how to build their own
components, tooling & using the Github & Bower communities, and other front end
developer goodness.

Zeno, began a small project, [CustomElements.io](http://customelements.io/),
that was meant to track his and others Web Components. CustomElements.io, now
used by Mozilla as their [X-Tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) registry, has become
much more than that and is now a central place for developers to share, publish,
and maintain their Web Components. The project spawned an incredible amount of
support from the web development community that grew into several other related
projects such as [WebComponents.org](http://webcomponents.org/) & the boilerplate
Yeoman project [generator-element](https://github.com/webcomponents/generator-element).
