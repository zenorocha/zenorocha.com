Today, Paul Miller released a nice list of the "[Most active GitHub users](https://gist.github.com/2657075)".

People started to talk about it and suddenly I received a lot of congratulations messages for being the #50 most active contributor on Github.

I was pretty surprised, since there's almost 2 million users on Github and even because [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), creator of Linux, was behind me!

That was pretty nice for my ego, but let me explain what this ranking means for me.

<!-- more -->

## Quantity != Quality

The first thing is, I'm not better than anyone.

Just because I made 100 commits more than Linus, it doesn’t make me a better contributor than him. Actually I could do 10,000 commits more than him and I would still not being a better contributor.

The only thing that these numbers shows is: those people on the list put a lot of effort on open source using Github.

And this is true, I definitely had a tough year working on some many different projects out there.

## People just don't get "commits"

We all have a lot of tasks to do daily, so how to deal with them using Git?

Let's say you have a task called "Redesign my blog".

Some people start coding it, making a lot of changes and when it's finished: `git add . && git commit -m "Redesigned my blog"`.

This is so wrong. What happens if you want to revert just a single improvement that was not so good there? You'll need to revert the whole commit.

That's why you have to break your tasks into sub tasks. It seems like a basic thing, but people just don't do it.

## 1st place

![OctoTJ](/img/posts/octotj.jpg)

If I had to guess who's going to be in the top of this list, that would be TJ ([@visionmedia](http://github.com/visionmedia)).

He's doing an incredible job in the NodeJS community, so congratulations man, you deserve it :)
