This month marks a significant milestone for us — the 10th anniversary of Dracula.

What started as one theme for one application, has now become a global movement.

Today, there are more than 6 million Dracula users on VSCode alone. So we thought it would be a good idea to share what we've been up to and what's next for the project.

## A decade of contributions

Even though I pushed the [first commit](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/commit/7e4d17ade6a54b7b7d8037a0d2160a293f17ef5c) to Dracula, I'm not the only one responsible for its success. Over the years, more than **734 contributors** have created themes for all sorts of applications.

The Dracula theme is everywhere now, from code editors to music apps, from terminals to websites. Today, there are **355 official themes**, which is absolutely crazy.

## A new look

To celebrate this incredible milestone, we're launching a new website designed and developed by the super-talented Lucas ([@luxonauta](https://twitter.com/luxonauta)).

With an ever-growing selection of apps supported, we needed a better way to showcase all the themes. The new homepage brings an App Store look-n-feel with a focus on discoverability, making it easier to find what you're looking for.

The new contributing guide includes tips and guidelines for those who want to create a new theme, and a color palette presented in different color formats.

On top of the visual experience, you'll also find some nice little details across the new website, including a few sound interactions :)

## The next 10 years

A lot has happened in the last ten years, but there's a lot we still want to do.

We're on a quest to create the **best cross-platform theme in the world**. We want to transform the industry and provide a consistent experience across all applications.

We believe that every single app should have a Dracula theme installed, and the best part is that [you can help us make it happen](/contribute).

## Thank you!

Thank you for creating themes, for sharing them with your friends, for writing about them, for talking about them when you screen share with your coworkers, for contributing to them, for being part of this journey.

We're so grateful for all the support we've received over the years.
