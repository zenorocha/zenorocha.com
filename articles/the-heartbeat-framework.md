_"How did your startup grow so fast?"_

I've been getting that question a lot, and I believe it comes down to a single word: **momentum**.

We tried to codify momentum and came up with a new concept called...

## The Heartbeat Framework

Getting momentum is extremely hard, and losing it is very easy.

As makers, we not only have to ship software. We have to ship and talk about it. We have to push new content constantly if we want to create a feeling of “always shipping”.

That's why we think about our efforts as a heartbeat.

It's a rhythm that we follow to expose internal momentum to the outside world. Just like a heartbeat, there are big peaks followed by small peaks.

It's important to have a balance between them, but the beat must be always present for people to know we are _"alive."_

In contrast, if there's a flat line, it means we are _"dead"_ and don't have momentum anymore.

## How it works

The framework is divided into:

- A) Launch Weeks
- B) Mini-Launches
- C) Change log
- D) Blog
- E) Customer story
- F) Social post

## A) Launch Weeks

_Frequency: 2-3x/year_

Launch Weeks are the big peaks. It's when we launch 5 new features in 5 days.

As the biggest "sign of life", launch weeks are often the most impactful way we share our momentum. But we are also careful not to do them too frequently, since they require a heavy "cost" from the team.

## B) Mini-Launch

_Frequency: 4-5x/year_

Mini-Launches are small wins that are worth sharing in a more detailed way, but don't require the same level of planning and coordination as Launch Weeks.

## C) Change log

_Frequency: 1-2x/month_

As we update the product, we post regular change logs to highlight how the product is evolving.

A fun exercise is to create an internal streak to motivate the team, so you don't miss a single week/month without shipping.

## D) Blog

_Frequency: 1-2x/month_

There's nothing more telling than going to a company blog and seeing the last post from 1 year ago.

## E) Customer stories

_Frequency: 1-2x/month_

We exist to serve real developers, so it's important for us to talk to our customers and share their experiences.

These are not only crucial for attracting new customers, but also to keep the team motivated with real stories of how our product is helping people.

## F) Social posts

_Frequency: 1x/day_

We try to be very active in only a few places. We found that X and LinkedIn are the most effective places for us to be at this moment.

## Conclusion

Startups are all about momentum, so make sure you don't lose it once you find it.

I hope this was helpful.
